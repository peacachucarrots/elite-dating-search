    Algorithms treat you as data. Our team treats you as <em>legacy</em>. Before you invest,
    make sure you’re in the right season to leverage bespoke matchmaking.

  <h2>1 · You have <em>time scarcity</em>, not date scarcity</h2>
  <p>
    Your calendar resembles a Tetris board. Outsourcing the search buys back
    hundreds of hours a year.  
  </p>

  <h2>2 · Quality now outranks quantity</h2>
  <p>
    Endless first dates felt thrilling at 28. At 38, you’d rather meet one
    vetted partner than fifty maybes.  
  </p>

  <h2>3 · You can articulate your non-negotiables</h2>
  <p>
    Matchmakers aren’t magicians; clarity fuels the magic.&nbsp;…  
  </p>

  <h2>4 · You want accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Personalized coaching, feedback loops, post-date debriefs—think of us as
    your board of advisors for love.  
  </p>

  <h2>5 · You value privacy (and discretion)</h2>
  <p>
    Swiping leaves a digital footprint. Our searches are confidential by design.
