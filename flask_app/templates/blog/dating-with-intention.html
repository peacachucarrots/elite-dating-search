  <h2>1. Audit your personal brand</h2>
  <p>
    The way investors scour a pitch deck, potential partners scan the “signals” you emit
    online and IRL. Tighten up social profiles, clarify lifestyle photos, and let values—not
    humble-brags—do the talking.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Replace volume-dating with precision-targeting</h2>
  <p>
    Treat your love life like a well-funded search: define non-negotiables, identify
    high-density channels (think professional organizations, alumni networks, niche
    events) and measure ROI in <em>quality × compatibility</em>, not match counts.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Run a “culture-fit” interview</h2>
  <p>
    Great relationships are cultural mergers. Swap the usual small talk for purpose-driven
    prompts—“What’s a risk you’re proud of?” or “How do you recharge after a 70-hour
    week?”—and watch surface chemistry deepen into mission alignment.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Sustainable chemistry = shared vision + reciprocal respect. One without the other is a
    short-term hire.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>4. Appoint a board of advisors</h2>
  <p>
    From a discreet matchmaking firm (hi 👋) to a therapist or executive coach, curate
    experts who keep your dating thesis honest and your blind spots exposed.
